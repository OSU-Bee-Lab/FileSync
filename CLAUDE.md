# FileSync

A Fyne desktop app for syncing experiment data between local folders and cloud
remotes (SharePoint/OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, S3) via rclone.

## Layout

- `main.go` — entry point.
- `internal/ui` — Fyne screens (one file per screen) and shared widgets.
- `internal/syncengine` — rclone-backed sync/copy/scan logic and Location model.
- `internal/rcbackends` — remote backend definitions and field metadata.
- `internal/appconfig` — persisted config (Locations, filters, preferences).

## Data schema

This app is built around the lab's data storage schema (experiment directories,
recorder directories, metadata.csv/README.txt, audio-file naming, and the three
synced locations). See [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) and reference it for any work that
touches how experiment data is structured, scanned, or validated (e.g. an
option to scan experiments).

## Imperatives

- Always use the OS-native file browser, never Fyne's in-app file/folder
  browser. Route all folder and file picking through `chooseFolder`,
  `chooseFileSave`, and `chooseFileOpen` (see `folder_picker_darwin.go` for the
  native implementation and `folder_picker_other.go` for the fallback).
- Never duplicate logic. If an existing pathway needs to be used in another
  place, extract it into a shared abstraction and call it from both, rather
  than copying it.
- Window-stretches-across-monitors bug: Fyne sets a window's min size from its
  content's min size, so a wide child forces the window wider than windowSize.
  This is fixed universally in `state.setContent`, which wraps content in
  `boundedWidthLayout` (caps min width to windowSize). So: always swap content
  via `setContent`, never `win.SetContent`. Set `Truncation` on labels holding
  long paths for looks, but the window itself can no longer be stretched.
- Do not commit changes until the user has tested and verified them working.
- This is a native macOS GUI app (Fyne) with no screenshot/automation
  harness. Never attempt to "visually verify" UI changes yourself (launching
  the app to screenshot it, click through it, etc.) — you have no way to see
  a native window. Build/vet/test to confirm it compiles and passes existing
  tests, then hand off to the user to check it in the running app.
- Worktrees go in ./.claude/worktrees
- Features that are incomplete or still being stabilized should stay hidden
  from release builds by gating them behind `devMode()`
  (`internal/ui/features.go`), which is on when the `FILESYNC_DEV` env var is
  set to any non-empty value (`FILESYNC_DEV=1 go run .`). This reveals
  dev-only features at runtime without rebuilding.
- **rclone must always use `copy`, never `sync`** — this is a core safety
  invariant. `rclone sync` deletes destination-only files; this app must
  never delete data from a synced destination — with the single narrow,
  user-gated exception of N-way conflict resolution (see below). The UI
  intentionally uses the word "sync" for end-user clarity (researchers
  understand "sync" intuitively), but the underlying rclone command is
  always `copy`. Never change this without an explicit, informed decision
  by the project owner.
- This never-delete rule scopes to rclone/cloud destinations only. It does
  not cover `internal/recorder`'s recorder-side deletion: once a file has
  been copied off a recorder (Sony ICD-PX370, Olympus VN-541PC, ...) and
  verified byte-for-byte, deleting it from the recorder's own storage is
  intentional and user-toggleable (`RecorderSettings.AutoDeleteAfterVerify`)
  — it's how a recorder gets reset for reuse in the field, not data loss.
- The one authorized deletion from a synced destination is N-way conflict
  resolution (`syncengine.NWayDelete` / `DeleteConflictFile`): when two or
  more locations hold genuinely different content at the same path, the user
  may choose to delete a specific location's copy. It is gated — they see
  every divergent copy with its size and location, pick deletion deliberately
  per file, and confirm an irreversible-action prompt. It must never be
  reachable as a default, automatically, or without that confirmation. All
  other N-way propagation stays copy-only: it never deletes a file from a
  location just because another location lacks it.
